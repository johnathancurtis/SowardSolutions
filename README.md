## Part 3
What is Entity Framework?

Enity Framework is Microsoft's Object to relational mapping (ORM) framework. 
It is used to link Dbs and web apps together.

What is a Connection String?

A connection string is a string created to connect to SQL databases from the code itself.
It contains the DB used, and the login for the DB.

What is a Database Context?

DB Context is the mapping of a specific DB with a schema the program can understand.

What is a Model Repository?

A model repository is used to reduce repetition in your DB, and is used to retrieve a sequence of DB objects.
This sequence can be queried, and any class that depends on the model repository can utilize these features.

Migration vs Scaffolding?

Migration is the compiler creating DB tables for you with the context provided.
Scaffolding is the compiler creating code for cshtml and html documents with the context.
